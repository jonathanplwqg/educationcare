- Submission Timeliness
- Banked Assessments
- Learning Pace

### 🎓 Prediction Output

1. **Outcome Prediction**
   - Distinction / Pass / Fail / Withdrawn
   - Confidence score (with gauge)
   - Probability distribution

2. **Student Persona** (6 clusters from your analysis)
   - High Achievers
   - Engaged Achievers
   - Active but Struggling
   - Experienced Repeaters
   - Fast but Disengaged
   - Struggling & Withdrawn

3. **Personalized Feedback** (4 tabs)
   - ✅ Strengths Recognition
   - ⚠️ Areas for Improvement
   - 🎯 Customized Action Plan
   - 📚 Resource Recommendations

4. **Visual Analytics**
   - Outcome probabilities chart
   - Feature importance analysis
   - Risk factor indicators
   - Confidence gauge

## 🚀 How to Run (3 Easy Steps)

### Option 1: Automated (Recommended)
```bash
bash quick_start.sh
```

### Option 2: Manual

**Step 1:** Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Step 2:** (Optional) Save your model
- Open `Final.ipynb`
- Copy code from `save_model_cell.py`
- Paste into new cell and run
- Model files will be created

**Step 3:** Run the app
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

**Step 4:** Open browser
- Navigate to http://localhost:8501
- Start making predictions!

## 💡 Two Modes Available

### Demo Mode (No Model Files)
- ✅ Works immediately
- ✅ Rule-based predictions
- ✅ Full UI/UX
- ✅ All feedback features
- ⚠️ Not using your trained ML model

### Full Mode (With Model Files)
- ✅ Real ML predictions
- ✅ Actual probabilities from your model
- ✅ Cluster assignments from UMAP analysis
- ✅ Production-ready

**To enable Full Mode:**
1. Run cell from `save_model_cell.py` in your notebook
2. Model files (model.pkl, scaler.pkl, etc.) will be created
3. Restart the app

## 📊 App Workflow

```
User Input (Sidebar)
    ↓
Feature Engineering (Automatic)
    ↓
Model Prediction (ML or Demo)
    ↓
Outcome + Confidence
    ↓
Cluster Assignment (Persona)
    ↓
Personalized Feedback
    ↓
Visual Analytics
```

## 🎨 Customization

All customizable! Modify:
- **Colors**: Edit CSS in app.py (lines 14-43)
- **Feedback**: Edit messages (lines 500-650)
- **Clusters**: Update `CLUSTER_INTERPRETATIONS` (lines 48-84)
- **Inputs**: Add/remove form fields (lines 86-270)
- **Charts**: Change Plotly visualizations (lines 450+)

## 📈 Data Flow

```python
# 1. User fills form → Raw inputs
gender = "M"
age_band = "0-35"
avg_score = 75.0
...

# 2. Feature engineering → Calculated features
activity_diversity = min(activity_count / 20, 1.0)
engagement_cv = 1 - engagement_consistency
score_per_weight = avg_score / studied_credits
...

# 3. Model prediction → Outcome
prediction = model.predict(features)
# → "Pass" with 78% confidence

# 4. Cluster assignment → Persona
cluster = cluster_model.predict(features)
# → "Engaged Achievers" (Cluster 2)

# 5. Feedback generation → Personalized advice
if avg_score >= 70:
    strengths.append("Strong Academic Performance")
if submission_timeliness <= 0:
    strengths.append("Excellent Time Management")
...
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| ModuleNotFoundError | Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` |
| Model not found | Either save model OR use demo mode |
| App won't start | Check you're in correct directory |
| Import errors | Update packages: `pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt` |
| Predictions wrong | Verify model files match your notebook |
