# 🌍 English Learning Success Predictor - Quick Start Guide

## What We've Built

A **student-friendly interface** that translates natural English learning activities into your existing model's technical features. This means:

✅ **No retraining needed** - Uses your existing LightGBM classifier
✅ **Student-friendly inputs** - Natural questions about learning habits
✅ **Meaningful feedback** - Actionable advice for English learners
✅ **Context-appropriate** - Focused on English language learning

## How It Works

### 🔄 The Translation Layer

Your model was trained on technical features like:
- `engagement_cv` (coefficient of variation)
- `module_engagement_rate` (clicks per day)
- `weighted_engagement` (adjusted clicks)
- `activity_type` (technical platform features)

The new app translates student-friendly inputs into these technical features:

| Student Input | → | Technical Feature |
|--------------|---|-------------------|
| "Lessons per week" | → | `count`, `sum` |
| "Study consistency" | → | `engagement_cv` |
| "Assignment timeliness" | → | `submission_timeliness` |
| "Primary learning method" | → | `activity_type` |
| "Skills practiced" | → | `activity_diversity` |
| "Average lesson score" | → | `score`, `score_per_weight` |

### 📋 Student-Friendly Questions

Instead of asking for technical metrics, we ask:

**Study Habits:**
- ✅ "How many lessons do you complete per week?" (1-30)
- ✅ "How many exercises per lesson?" (1-30)
- ✅ "How consistent is your study schedule?" (Very Consistent → Very Inconsistent)

**Performance:**
- ✅ "What's your average lesson score?" (0-100%)
- ✅ "How often do you complete assignments on time?" (Always Early → Often Late)

**Engagement:**
- ✅ "What's your primary learning method?" (Reading, Writing, Speaking, etc.)
- ✅ "Which skills do you practice regularly?" (Multi-select: Reading, Writing, Listening, Speaking, Grammar)

**Background:**
- ✅ "Is this your first time taking this course?" (First Time, Second Attempt, Third+)
- ✅ "How many weeks have you been in the course?" (1-52)

## 🚀 Running the App

### Option 1: Run the New English Learning App (Recommended)

```bash
streamlit run app_english_learning.py
```

### Option 2: Keep Both Versions

You now have:
- `app.py` - Original technical version
- `app_english_learning.py` - Student-friendly English learning version

Run either one depending on your needs.

## 📝 Customization Tips

### To Add More Feedback Rules:

Edit the feedback generation sections (around line 500-700):

```python
# Add new improvement check
if lessons_per_week < 5 and average_lesson_score > 70:
    improvements.append({
        'title': '📈 **Increase Practice for Even Better Results**',
        'issue': 'You score well but could learn faster with more practice',
        'tips': [
            "You clearly understand the material",
            "Increase to 5+ lessons per week",
            "You could finish the course faster",
            "Maintain your high quality work"
        ]
    })
```

### To Modify Learner Personas:

Update the `LEARNER_PERSONAS` dictionary (around line 180):

```python
LEARNER_PERSONAS = {
    0: {
        "name": "Your Custom Persona Name",
        "description": "Description of this learner type",
        "risk_level": "Low/Medium/High",
        "color": "success/warning/danger"
    },
    # Add more personas...
}
```

### To Connect Your Real Model:

Replace the demo prediction logic (around line 500):

```python
if model is None:
    # Demo mode
    ...
else:
    # Real model prediction
    # 1. Combine technical_features and categorical_features
    # 2. Create feature vector matching your training data
    # 3. Apply scaling/encoding
    # 4. Get prediction
    # 5. Map back to student-friendly outcome
```
